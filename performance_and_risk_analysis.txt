🔬 How Malicious Extensions Can Harm Users

1️⃣ Data Theft
Malicious extensions can capture keystrokes, form data, passwords, and credit card numbers.

2️⃣ Browser Hijacking
They may inject ads, redirect search results, or change your homepage and search engine settings without permission.

3️⃣ Behavioral Tracking
Track your browsing history and online behavior to sell to advertisers or data brokers.

4️⃣ Credential Stealing
Some steal cookies or tokens and impersonate you on banking or social sites.

5️⃣ Stealth & Persistence
They may delay malicious behavior or act only on certain sites to evade detection.

💡 Conclusion:
Browser extensions can deeply affect your security and privacy. Always review permissions and only install from trusted sources.
