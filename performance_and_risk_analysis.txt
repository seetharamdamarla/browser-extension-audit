How Malicious Extensions Can Harm Users

1) Data Theft
Malicious extensions can capture keystrokes, form data, passwords, and credit card numbers.

2) Browser Hijacking
They may inject ads, redirect search results, or change your homepage and search engine settings without permission.

3) Behavioral Tracking
Track your browsing history and online behavior to sell to advertisers or data brokers.

4) Credential Stealing
Some steal cookies or tokens and impersonate you on banking or social sites.

5) Stealth & Persistence
They may delay malicious behavior or act only on certain sites to evade detection.

Conclusion:
Browser extensions can deeply affect your security and privacy. Always review permissions and only install from trusted sources.
